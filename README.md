# Rust-for-Web
Remarks and brief examples having to do with use of Rust in Web service

## Varieties of Web Experience

Rust's garbage-collection-less advantages and benefits (Discord found it [bested Go in "... every single performance metric ...](https://medium.com/discord-engineering/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f), and so on) apply in particular in Web applications.  This repository introduces the
topic of Rust's use in Web service sorted in broad architectural terms.
- Simplest possible Web service with base Rust
- Rust CGI
- Static Web sites generated with Rust
- Rust-oriented Web application service
- Firefox Quantum Web browser
- Locuses of Rust intelligence

## Simplest possible Web service with base Rust

[Explanation here.]

Andrew Lader has a [47-line "Simple HTTP Server in Rust"](https://gist.github.com/andrewlader/df0e1a52fd4a842c6110d28cf1b281a1#file-main-http-rs).  [Provide usage for those utterly unfamiliar with Rust.]  Comparable implementations in Go fill fewer than thirty lines, and in Python or Ruby line counts are between fifteen and two dozen [provide references].  Lader supplies more detail in "[Should I Rust, or Should I Go](https://codeburst.io/should-i-rust-or-should-i-go-59a298e00ea9)"

## Rust CGI

## Static Web sites generated with Rust

[Explanation here.]

## Rust-oriented Web application service

Sascha Grunert supplies a [complete small authentication demonstration](https://github.com/saschagrunert/webapp.rs/tree/rev1).

## Firefox Quantum Web browser
